> **PharmaCare** is an enterprise-grade academic pharmacy management and inventory monitoring system built entirely in Python. It simulates real-world clinical hospital dispensary operations with statutory **First-Expiry-First-Out (FEFO)** batch allocation, **Schedule H prescription validation**, **automatic expiry quarantine**, **live inventory valuation**, **ReportLab PDF invoicing**, and **immutable audit logging**.

---

## 🌟 Key System Capabilities

- **🛒 Point of Sale (POS) Counter Billing:** Multi-item cart builder, customer profile lookup, instant FEFO earliest-batch allocation, GST tax computation, and instant downloadable **ReportLab PDF Invoices**.
- **⏳ Smart Expiry & Quarantine Monitor:** Real-time categorization into *Expired (Quarantined)*, *Expiring Soon (≤30 Days)*, and *Safe*. Includes financial loss calculation and bio-waste compliance disposal workflows.
- **⚠️ Low-Stock Replenishment Queue:** Tracks available stock against safety thresholds (`min_stock`) and computes suggested purchase reorder quantities.
- **🩺 Schedule H / Rx Prescription Validation:** Restricts dispensing of controlled drugs and antibiotics unless linked to an authorized doctor prescription.
- **📥 Inward Stock Procurement:** Multi-item purchase intake that automatically registers or increments physical batch lots and updates purchase cost records.
- **📊 Interactive Executive Dashboard:** Plotly dual-axis revenue timelines (7/14/30 days), category distribution doughnut charts, top-selling medications, and live alert banners.
- **📑 Comprehensive Financial Reports:** Date-range filtered sales statements, itemized profit margin analytics, live inventory valuation (Cost vs Retail MRP), and PDF summary reports.
- **👥 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Multi-tier permissions (`Admin` vs `Pharmacist`) protecting administrative settings, user management, and audit logs.
- **💾 Database Hot Backup & Restore:** One-click SQLite binary snapshot download and schema-verified file restoration.

## 🏗️ 3-Layer Architecture Overview

```
PharmaCare System Architecture
├── Presentation Layer (Streamlit Pages in app/pages/)
│   └── Never touches database sessions; catches typed exceptions & shows clean toasts.
├── Domain Business Services (app/services/)
│   └── All transactions, business rules, FEFO allocation, RBAC guards, and audit logging.
└── Data Access & Models (app/models/ & app/core/database.py)
    └── 14 Declarative SQLAlchemy 2.x models with SQLite foreign key PRAGMA enforcement.
```

## 🚀 Quick Start & Installation

### 1. Clone & Setup Environment
```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd PharmaCare-Smart-Pharmacy-Management-Inventory-Monitoring

# Create virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Initialize Database & Seed Demo Data
```powershell
# Run the database seeder (populates users, categories, medicines, batches, customers, and sales)
py scripts/seed.py
```

### 3. Launch the Application
```powershell
py -m streamlit run app/main.py
```
